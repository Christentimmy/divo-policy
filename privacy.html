    <h1>Divo - Help & App Information</h1>
    <p><strong>Version:</strong> Divo v1.0.0</p>

    <h2>About Divo</h2>
    <p>
      Divo is a secure, open-source voice calling application designed to provide
      reliable voice communication over the internet using SIP (Session
      Initiation Protocol). Based on the Linphone framework, Divo focuses
      exclusively on voice calls, offering a streamlined and intuitive calling
      experience while maintaining enterprise-grade security and privacy
      features.
    </p>

    <h2>What is Divo?</h2>
    <p>
      Divo is a voice-only communication app that allows you to make
      high-quality voice calls over the internet. Unlike traditional phone
      calls, Divo uses Voice over IP (VoIP) technology to transmit your voice
      data over internet connections, making it possible to call anywhere in the
      world at no additional cost beyond your internet connection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The app is built with privacy and security as core principles, ensuring
      your conversations remain private and encrypted.
    </p>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <h3>Initial Setup & Permissions</h3>
    <p>
      When you first launch Divo, you'll be guided through a simple setup
      process. The app requires microphone permission to enable voice calls –
      this is essential for the app's core functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may also be asked for contacts permission, which is optional and only
      used to help you easily find and call your contacts. If you deny optional
      permissions, the app will still work but some convenience features may be
      limited.
    </p>

    <h3>Setting Up Your SIP Account</h3>
    <p>
      To make calls with Divo, you'll need a SIP account. During the initial
      setup, you'll be prompted to complete the registration page. Once
      configured, your account is automatically registered with the Divo server
      (or your chosen SIP provider), allowing you to make and receive calls.
    </p>

    <h3>Making Your First Call</h3>
    <p>
      To make a call, open the Dialpad tab in the bottom navigation. Enter the
      phone number (including country code if needed), then tap the call
      button. Divo will automatically handle the connection process and attempt
      to establish a voice connection.
    </p>

    <h2>Main Features</h2>

    <h3>Dialpad</h3>
    <p>
      The Dialpad provides a familiar phone keypad interface for placing calls.
      You can enter numbers manually and tap the call button to start a call.
    </p>

    <h3>Contacts Management</h3>
    <p>
      The Contacts tab allows you to manage and quickly access your contacts.
      When you grant contacts permission, Divo can read contacts from your
      device's address book to make calling easier. Contacts data is only used
      locally on your device for call initiation.
    </p>

    <h3>Call History</h3>
    <p>
      The History tab provides a log of your call activity. You can view
      outgoing calls along with contact name (if available), phone number, date
      and time of the call, and call duration. You can tap on a history entry to
      quickly initiate a call back to that number.
    </p>

    <h2>Audio Quality and Codecs</h2>
    <p>
      Divo supports multiple audio codecs to ensure optimal call quality.
      Codecs are algorithms that compress and decompress audio data, balancing
      sound quality and bandwidth usage. Popular codecs supported include Opus,
      G.722, G.711 and others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Higher-quality codecs like Opus provide superior sound quality but may use
      more bandwidth, while G.711 is more compatible but uses more bandwidth.
      You can adjust codec preferences in the Settings tab under <em>Audio
      Codecs</em> to prioritize quality or compatibility based on your network
      conditions.
    </p>

    <h2>Settings and Customization</h2>

    <h3>Audio Codec Settings</h3>
    <p>
      In the Settings tab, you can enable or disable specific codecs and set
      their priority. Keeping all codecs enabled is generally recommended for
      maximum compatibility. If you experience call quality issues, you may
      choose to disable some codecs or adjust their order.
    </p>

    <h3>Network and Connection</h3>
    <p>
      Divo automatically handles network connectivity, switching between Wi‑Fi
      and mobile data where available. Call quality may vary depending on
      network strength and latency.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Divo is designed with privacy in mind. The app does not collect, store, or
      transmit your personal data beyond what is necessary to establish and
      manage calls.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Your contacts remain on your device and are only accessed (when
        permitted) to let you place calls more easily.
      </li>
      <li>
        Call history is stored locally on your phone and is not uploaded to
        remote servers by the app.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divo does not use your personal information for advertising or tracking
        purposes.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Open Source and Transparency</h2>
    <p>
      Divo is an open‑source application. Its source code is publicly available
      for review and contributions. Divo is based on
      <strong>“Linphone Belledonne Communications 2010–2025”</strong> and
      follows the <strong>GNU General Public License v3.0</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This transparency allows security researchers and privacy advocates to
      examine the code, ensuring that the app behaves as described and does not
      contain hidden backdoors or unauthorized data collection mechanisms.
    </p>

    <h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

    <h3>No Audio During Calls</h3>
    <p>
      If you can't hear the other party or they can't hear you:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Check that your device volume is turned up and not muted.</li>
      <li>Ensure Divo has microphone permission enabled in system settings.</li>
      <li>Try switching between speakerphone and earpiece modes.</li>
      <li>Verify your network connection quality (Wi‑Fi or mobile data).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Poor Call Quality</h3>
    <p>
      Call quality issues (choppy audio, delays, echoes) are usually related to
      network conditions. You can:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Switch between Wi‑Fi and mobile data and test again.</li>
      <li>Close other apps that are using a lot of bandwidth.</li>
      <li>Ensure you have a strong signal if on mobile data.</li>
      <li>
        Adjust codec settings to prioritize compatibility in poor network
        conditions.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Account Registration Issues</h3>
    <p>
      If your SIP account fails to register:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Double‑check your username and password.</li>
      <li>Ensure you have an active internet connection.</li>
      <li>
        Confirm server address and any special parameters required by your SIP
        provider.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you changed your SIP password, update it in Divo account settings.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Best Practices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use a stable Wi‑Fi connection where possible for best call quality.</li>
      <li>Ensure your device has adequate battery life for longer calls.</li>
      <li>Keep the app updated to the latest version.</li>
      <li>Review and manage your contacts regularly for a clean address book.</li>
      <li>
        Adjust codec and network‑related settings according to your typical
        network conditions.
      </li>
    </ul>
